What does this software do?
Provides a user friendly software centre for managing packages and updates for 
Arch based Linux distributions. Also handles downgrading packages in the even 
that a package breaks a user's system. This software centre is heavily inspired 
by the Solus OS software centre, in that it is very minimal, modern and fast. 
Finally, eventually there will be AUR support integrated into this software 
centre (but I want to get pacman support done first).

Dependencies
    - python 3 or later
    - pyqt5 (qt5)
    - pyalpm (and libalpm 4 or later)
